The image shown to the left is a sketch as well as associated code required to design a mechanism within a 150x50cm working space to lift a maximum weight to a maximum height. This is under the assumption that the bar is entirely rigid (cannot deform by bending or otherwise). There are two degrees of freedom - the weight of the object being lifted and the angle at which the bar is tilted (directly corresponds to the height the weight is lifted to). The maximum weight was 2312N to a maximum height of nearly 50cm. 

In the second image, the bar is no longer rigid while the remaining constraints stay the same. The beam bends due to both the actuator itself and the weight (on the end). The maximum deflection in the beam is 0.611m or 61.1 cm. The optimal length of the bar is 1.5m where the location of the actuator (a) is approximately 1.49m (at the right end of the bar). The maximum weight the beam can withold is 260.8N (approximately 26.6kg) and it can be lifted to nearly the height of the working space at 0.499m. If the allowable deflection is 2% of 1.5 (so 0.03m), the designed cross-section is a hollow tube with an inner radius of 37.5mm and an outer radius of 52.5mm. An image with accompanying work and drawing are provided.
