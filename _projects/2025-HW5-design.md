The image shown to the left is a sketch as well as associated code required to design a mechanism within a 150x50cm working space to lift a maximum weight to a maximum height. This is under the assumption that the bar is entirely rigid (cannot deform by bending or otherwise). There are two degrees of freedom - the weight of the object being lifted and the angle at which the bar is tilted (directly corresponds to the height the weight is lifted to). The maximum weight was 2312N to a maximum height of nearly 50cm. 

In the second image, the bar is no longer rigid while the remaining constraints stay the same. The beam bends due to both the actuator itself and the weight (on the end). The maximum deflection in the beam is ---
